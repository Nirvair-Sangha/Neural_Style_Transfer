# Neural_Style_Transfer

Program that allows the user to input an image and add an art style to it. I experimented with Warhol, Van Gogh, and Monet but there are lots of other possibilities and combinations to experiment with. I used the tensorflow hub model that was already online and I adjusted it to compensate for different art styles.
